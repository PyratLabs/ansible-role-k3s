## 2020-12-21, v2.4.0

### Notable changes

    to allow for easy removal of "Rancher" references #73.
  - `k3s_token_location` has moved to be in `k3s_config_dir`.
  - Tasks for creating directories now looped to caputure configuration from
    `k3s_server` and `k3s_agent` and ensure directories exist before k3s
    starts, see #75.
  - Server token collected directly from token file, not symlinked file
    (node-token).
  - `k3s_runtime_config` defined in `vars/` for validation and overwritten in
    tasks for control plane and workers.
  - Removed unused references to GitHub API.
  - `set_fact` and `command` tasks now use FQCN.

### Breaking changes

  - Ansible minimum version is hard set to v2.10.4

    role will create a duplicate file here.

## 2020-11-29, v2.0.0

### Notable changes

  - #64 - Initial release of v2.0.0 of
    [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s).
  - Minimum supported k3s version now: v1.19.1+k3s1
  - Minimum supported Ansible version now: v2.10.0
  - #62 - Remove all references to the word "master".
  - #53 - Move to file-based configuration.
  - Refactored to avoid duplication in code and make contribution easier.
  - Validation checks moved to using variables defined in `vars/`

### Breaking changes

#### File based configuration

Issue #53

With the release of v1.19.1+k3s1, this role has moved to file-based
configuration of k3s. This requires manuall translation of v1 configuration
variables into configuration file format.

Please see: https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/install-options/#configuration-file

#### Minimum supported k3s version

As this role now relies on file-based configuration, the v2.x release of this
role will only support v1.19+ of k3s. If you are not in a position to update
k3s you will need to continue using the v1.x release of this role, which will
be supported until March 2021<!-- 1 year after k8s v1.18 release -->.

#### Minimum supported ansible version

This role now only supports Ansible v2.10+, this is because it has moved on to
using FQDNs, with the exception of `set_fact` tasks which have
[been broken](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72319) and the fixes
have [not yet been backported to v2.10](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71824).

The use of FQDNs allows for custom modules to be introduced to override task
behavior. If this role requires a custom ansible module to be introduced then
this can be added as a dependency and targeted specifically by using the
correct FQDN.
