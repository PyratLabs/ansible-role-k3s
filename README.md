# Ansible Role: k3s

Ansible role for installing [Racher Labs k3s](https://k3s.io/) ("Lightweight
Kubernetes") as either a standalone server or cluster.

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s)

## Requirements

The control host requires the following Python dependencies:

  - `jmespath >= 0.9.0`

This role has been tested on Ansible 2.7.0+ against the following Linux Distributions:

  - Amazon Linux 2
  - CentOS 8
  - CentOS 7
  - Debian 9
  - Debian 10
  - Fedora 29
  - Fedora 30
  - Fedora 31
  - openSUSE Leap 15
  - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

## Disclaimer

:warning: May not be suitable for production use!

Rancher Labs is awesome and has released k3s as v1.0.0, however at the time of
creating this role I do not have a k3s cluster in production nor am I unlikely
to ever have one. Please ensure you practice extreme caution and operational
rigor before using this role for any serious workloads.

If you have any problems please create a GitHub issue, I maintain this role in
my spare time so I cannot promise a speedy fix delivery.

#### Important note about `k3s_release_version`

If you do not set a `k3s_release_version` the latest version of k3s will be
installed. If you are developing against a specific version of k3s you must
ensure this is set in your Ansible configuration, eg:

```yaml
k3s_release_version: v0.2.0
```

#### Important note about `k3s_non_root`

To install k3s as non root you must not use `become: true`. The intention of
this variable is to run a single node development environment. At the time
of release v1.0.1, rootless is still experimental.

You must also ensure that you set `k3s_use_experimental` to `true`.

Additionally `k3s_install_dir` must be writable by your user.

#### Important notes about `k3s_control_node_address` and `k3s_control_token`

If you set this, you are explicitly specifying the control host that agents
should connect to, the value should be an IP address or FQDN.

If the control host is not configured by this role, then you need to also
specify the `k3s_control_token`.

Please note that this may potentially break setting up agents.

### Host Variables

Below are variables that are set against specific hosts in your inventory.

| Variable                         | Description                                                              | Default Value          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `k3s_control_node`               | Define the host as a control plane node, (True/False).                   | `false`                |
| `k3s_node_name`                  | Define the name of this node.                                            | `$(hostname)`          |
| `k3s_node_id`                    | Define the ID of this node.                                              | _NULL_                 |
| `k3s_flannel_interface`          | Define the flannel proxy interface for this node.                        | _NULL_                 |
| `k3s_bind_address`               | Define the bind address for this node.                                   | localhost              |
| `k3s_node_ip_address`            | IP Address to advertise for this node.                                   | _NULL_                 |
| `k3s_node_external_address`      | External IP Address to advertise for this node.                          | _NULL_                 |
| `k3s_node_labels`                | List of node labels.                                                     | _NULL_                 |
| `k3s_node_taints`                | List of node taints.                                                     | _NULL_                 |
| `k3s_node_data_dir`              | Folder to hold state.                                                    | `/var/lib/rancher/k3s` |
| `k3s_tls_san`                    | Add additional hosname or IP as Subject Alternate Name in the TLS cert.  | _NULL_                 |

#### Important note about `k3s_control_node` and High Availability (HA)

By default only one host will be defined as a control node by Ansible, If you
do not set a host as a control node, the role will automatically delegate
the first play host as a control node (master). This is not suitable for use in
a Production workload.

If multiple hosts have `k3s_control_node` set to true, you must also set
`k3s_datastore_endpoint` as the connection string to a MySQL or PostgreSQL
database, or etcd cluster else the play will fail.

If using TLS, the CA, Certificate and Key need to already be available on
the play hosts.

See: [High Availability with an External DB](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/ha/)

Since K3s v1.0.0 it is possible to use DQLite as the backend database, and this
is done by setting `k3s_dqlite_datastore` to true. As this is an experimental
feature you will also need to set `k3s_use_experimental` to true.

#### Important note about `k3s_flannel_interface`

If you are running k3s on systems with multiple network interfaces, it is
necessary to have the flannel interface on a network interface that is routable
to the master node(s).

#### Notes about `k3s_node_labels` and `k3s_node_taints`

Both these variables are lists that will be iterated on. The below example will
output the following:

**YAML**:

```yaml
k3s_node_labels:
  - foo: bar
  - hello: world

k3s_node_taints:
  - key1: value1:NoExecute
```

**ARGS**:

```text
--node-label foo=bar \
--node-label hello=world \
--node-taint key1=value1:NoExecute
```
